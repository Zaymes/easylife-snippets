### Downloads file from list of source url
So if we have the list of urls that have to be manually downloaded. Just run the script that will download the files.


### How to use
- Create input file and name it as you want. `eg: inputList.txt`
- List down the url sources of files you want to download line by line in this created file.
- Run bash script `./download_pdflist.sh inputList.txt`
- The download resources should be inside folders named `downloads`
